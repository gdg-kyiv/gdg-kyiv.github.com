/* WEBSITE */

This is a work-in-progress on the new GDG Kyiv-Center website.
The old website is at http://gtug.org.ua.

/* TEAM */

The site was created by me (Tymur Porkuian). 
My personal blog is at http://gplus.to/fixpoint.
My programming blog is at http://gplus.to/leastfixedpoint.

/* THANKS */

To everyone who provided suggestions.
Special thanks to Google for the GDG logo.

The background of the header was stolen from http://archunion.com.ua/panorama-kiev_013.shtml.
They don't specify usage terms on their website and we're non-commercial, so I hope that it's OK.
